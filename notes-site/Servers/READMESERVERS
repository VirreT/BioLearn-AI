The servers are dependent on each other. If you want to use the chatbot you need to have both servers up and running.

The main server is just the " frontend " that sends the json package to the " cors server " which then sends and recieves json package/packages from the ChatGPT API.

Main <--> CORS <--> ChatGPT API



You also need som dependencies to have this code run on your machine at home.

1. You need Node.js downloaded and set up

2. Make a folder with both servers inside and open one them in a admin command prompt 

3. Type " npm init -y ". This will intialize the folder and make it ready for Node.js

4. type " npm install express axios dotenv body-parser cors " in admin command prompt. This will install all the dependencies required and will get the code to run

5. In this case we have 2 different servers in 2 different folders so do this again for the other server's folder

Now you can run the servers by typing " node server.js " if you are in the cors-proxy folder and " node servermain.js " if you are in the main folder.
